# GPT-2-model-finetuning
Fine-tuning GPT-2 for text summarization and question answering using Hugging Face Transformers. Includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation in a Jupyter Notebook.
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to fine-tune OpenAI's GPT-2 model for two natural language processing (NLP) tasks: text summarization and question answering. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and sample predictions.

## Notebook Overview
File: Finetuning_a_GPT_2_model_for_text_summarization_and_question_answering.ipynb

This notebook walks through:

âœ… Loading and preprocessing custom text data

âœ… Fine-tuning a pretrained GPT-2 model using Hugging Face Transformers

âœ… Adapting GPT-2 for conditional generation tasks

âœ… Training the model on summarization and QA tasks

âœ… Evaluating the model and generating predictions

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
<pre>pip install transformers datasets torch</pre>

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
<pre>git clone https://github.com/OlaoyeData/GPT-2-model-finetuning.git
cd GPT-2-model-finetuning</pre>

2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
<pre>jupyter notebook</pre>

3. Open the notebook and run cells sequentially.

## Sample Use-Cases
1. Summarization: Condense long documents into shorter summaries.
2. Question Answering: Provide answers to questions based on a given context.

## Notes
1. This is an experimental implementation intended for educational use.
2. Fine-tuning large models can be resource-intensiveâ€”using a GPU is highly recommended.
3. The notebook uses Hugging Face's Trainer API for streamlined training.
